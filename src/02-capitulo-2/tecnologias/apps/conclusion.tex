\textit{Tomado desde \url{http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html\#why-use-rails-for-json-apis-questionmark}:}

\textit{The first question a lot of people have when thinking about building a JSON API using Rails is: ``isn't using Rails to spit out some JSON overkill? Shouldn't I just use something like Sinatra?''.\\* For very simple APIs, this may be true. However, even in very HTML-heavy applications, most of an application's logic is actually outside of the view layer.\\* The reason most people use Rails is that it provides a set of defaults that allows us to get up and running quickly without having to make a lot of trivial decisions.}
